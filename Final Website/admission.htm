        <p class="h5">
            The start of the journey of a Filipino youth who dreams to embrace the profession of arms, through the Philippine 
            Military Academy (PMA), 
            is when he submits his application form to the Office of Cadet Admission (OCA) for processing, so that he 
            can take the Philippine Military Academy Cadet Qualification Test (PMACQT).
            After receiving the Test Permit from the OCA, the applicant will report to the designated Examination Center on the date indicated 
            on the permit. The applicant is to bring said Test Permit so that s/he will be allowed by the Proctors to take the Exam. 
            If the applicant passes the Exam, s/he will receive a written notice from OCA informing him of the result of the Exam and 
            instructing him to report to AFP, Medical Center (AFPMC). He will then undergo the Complete Physical Examination (CPE) where
            his medical, physical, mental and emotional condition will be examined to determine his readiness and fitness for the military training in the Academy. CPE takes days, so a cadet candidate is required to stay in the billeting area provided by the Academy in AFPMC.
            If the applicant successfully makes it, he will be required to report to PMA Liaison Office in AFPMC for final processing 
            during the last week of March before s/he will be brought to Philippine Military Academy (PMA) on April 01 for the Oath-Taking Ceremony and Reception Rites, signaling his official entry to the Academy as member of a PMA Class.
            From then on, and during the four years stay in the Academy. S/he will undergo the education and training in the Academy 
            designed to prepare her/him into becoming an officer of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the soldier of the Filipino people.

        <p class="h5">
            PMA adopts a holistic view of man as body, soul, and spirit. PMA believes that future leaders can be selected, 
            formed, and developed to their fullest potentials. PMA is principally an institution for military leadership 
            and it is from the total view of man that PMA’s leader development program is based. It contains character 
            development, a balanced college education, military leadership, and physical development, necessary to prepare 
            the cadets for the profession of arms and to be responsive to the needs of the Armed Forces and the Nation.
